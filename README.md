# Nutrient-Temperament Investigation Project

## Overview
This project aims to investigate the relationship between dietary patterns and temperament development in children aged 1-2 years old. Specifically, we explore how different nutrient clusters may influence the temperament traits of toddlers.

## Research Questions
1. How does dietary intake influence the temperament development of toddlers?
2. Are there specific nutrient clusters associated with certain temperament traits in children aged 1-2 years?

## Analysis Steps
The project involves the following analysis steps:
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Characterization of children's characteristics and dietary intake.
- **Linear Mixed Effect Models**: Estimation of nutritional effects on temperament measures using statistical models.
- **Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)**: Clustered nutrients into groups based on correlations and obtain their factor loadings.
- **Visualization**: Results presented through network graphs, heatmaps, and bar plots.
- **Adjustment for Covariates**: Determining significant associations using t-tests and FDR correction.

## Tools Used
- **R (version 4.2.0)**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- **R Packages**:
    - **lavaan**: For structural equation modeling (SEM) and CFA.
    - **EGAnet**: For implementation of EGA algorithm.
    - **lme4** and **lmerTest**: For linear mixed effect models.

## Note
This project is conducted for research and educational purposes only. The findings should be interpreted within the context of the study's limitations and scope. The usage of code is subject to approval.
